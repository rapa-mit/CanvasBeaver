Canvas Beaver - Quick Start Guide

Building Better Grade Reports

WHAT IT DOES:
-------------
Computes grades based ONLY on assignments that have been graded (at least one
student has a non-zero score). Excludes ungraded/unassigned work and normalizes
weights proportionally.

BASIC USAGE:
------------
1. Set Canvas token:
   export CANVAS_TOKEN="your_canvas_api_token"

2. Run grade processor (REQUIRED: must specify --config):
   python3 process_grades.py --config grade_config_canvas.yaml

3. Check output:
   - Console shows which assignments are included
   - individual-grades/*.txt contains per-student reports
   - grades_summary.csv has the summary table
   - anomaly_report.txt lists students with grade pattern alerts

COMMAND-LINE OPTIONS:
---------------------
--config FILE           Config file (REQUIRED for drop_lowest to work)
                        Recommended: grade_config_canvas.yaml
--course-id ID          Canvas course ID (optional, will prompt if not given)
--output-dir DIR        Output directory (default: current directory)
--include-ungraded      Include ALL assignments (old behavior, treats ungraded as 0%)
--include-inactive      Include inactive student enrollments

EXAMPLES:
---------
# Partial semester grading (recommended):
python3 process_grades.py --config grade_config_canvas.yaml

# End of semester (include everything):
python3 process_grades.py --config grade_config_canvas.yaml --include-ungraded

# Specify course and output directory:
python3 process_grades.py --course-id 33045 --config grade_config_canvas.yaml --output-dir ./reports

# Test the logic without Canvas:
python3 test_partial_grading.py

WHAT TO EXPECT:
---------------
Console output will show:
  "Partial semester grading: 18 of 28 assignments have been graded"
  
  For each assignment type:
  "  Problem Sets: 9/13 graded, weight: 15.0% → 10.4%"
  
  Then normalization:
  "Total partial weight: 51.3% (will normalize to 100%)"

Individual reports will have:
  "GRADE REPORT (PARTIAL SEMESTER - Based on graded assignments only)"
  "CURRENT GRADE: 85.50% = B"
  "(Based on work assigned and graded to date)"

TROUBLESHOOTING:
----------------
Q: "Canvas access token required" error?
A: Set CANVAS_TOKEN environment variable

Q: All students still showing low grades?
A: Check if assignments actually have non-zero scores in Canvas

Q: Want old behavior?
A: Use --include-ungraded flag

Q: How do I know what's included?
A: Check console output - it lists all graded assignments by type
