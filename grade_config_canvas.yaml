# Grade Processing Configuration (Using Canvas Assignment Groups)
# ==================================================================
#
# This configuration uses assignment group weights defined in Canvas.
# No need to redefine grade types - they're pulled from the Canvas API!

# Use Canvas Assignment Groups
# -----------------------------
# When true, grade type weights are fetched from Canvas assignment groups
# This is the recommended mode - avoids duplication and stays in sync with Canvas
use_canvas_groups: true

# Drop Lowest Grades
# ------------------
# Number of lowest grades to drop for each assignment group
# Use the exact assignment group names from Canvas
drop_lowest:
  Problem Sets: 1      # Drop lowest problem set
  Quizlets: 1          # Drop lowest quizlet
  # Midterm: 0         # Don't drop midterm (default is 0)
  # Final exam: 0      # Never drop final exam!

# Letter Grade Scale (Optional)
# ------------------------------
# Path to custom letter grade scale YAML file
# If not specified, uses MIT-letter-grades.yaml by default
# letter_grade_scale: MIT-letter-grades.yaml
# letter_grade_scale: strict-letter-grades.yaml

# Notes:
# ------
# - Grade weights are taken from Canvas assignment group settings
# - Make sure "Weighted by Group" is enabled in Canvas course settings
# - Assignment group names in drop_lowest must exactly match Canvas names
# - This configuration stays in sync with Canvas automatically
