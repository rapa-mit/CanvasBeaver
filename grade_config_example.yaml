# Grade Processing Configuration (Manual Mode - Legacy)
# ======================================================
#
# This is the manual/legacy configuration mode where you explicitly define
# grade type weights. This is useful if:
# - Your Canvas course doesn't use assignment group weights
# - You want to override Canvas weights for special calculations
# - You're doing custom grading that differs from Canvas
#
# RECOMMENDED: Use grade_config_canvas.yaml instead to automatically
# pull weights from Canvas assignment groups!

# Use Manual Configuration
# -------------------------
use_canvas_groups: false

# Grade Types and Weights
# ------------------------
# Define each grade type with its weight (as a decimal, not percentage)
# Weights must sum to 1.0 (or less if allow_partial is true)
# NOTE: Names must match Canvas assignment groups exactly (including plural!)
grade_types:
  Problem Sets: 0.15   # Use "Problem Sets" (plural) to match Canvas
  Quizlets: 0.25       # Use "Quizlets" (plural) to match Canvas
  Midterm: 0.25
  Final exam: 0.35     # Use "Final exam" to match Canvas

# Drop Lowest Grades
# ------------------
# Number of lowest grades to drop for each type
# NOTE: Names must match Canvas assignment groups exactly (including plural!)
drop_lowest:
  Problem Sets: 1      # Use "Problem Sets" (plural) to match Canvas
  Quizlets: 1          # Use "Quizlets" (plural) to match Canvas

# Partial Semester Grading
# -------------------------
# Set to true for mid-semester grading when not all assignments exist yet
# This allows weights to sum to less than 1.0
allow_partial: false

# Letter Grade Scale (Optional)
# ------------------------------
# Path to custom letter grade scale YAML file
# If not specified, uses MIT-letter-grades.yaml by default
# letter_grade_scale: MIT-letter-grades.yaml
# letter_grade_scale: strict-letter-grades.yaml

# Example: Mid-semester configuration (no final exam yet)
# grade_types:
#   Problem Sets: 0.15
#   Quizlets: 0.25
#   Midterm: 0.25
# allow_partial: true
