# Test Modified Letter Grade Scale
# ================================
# 
# A test modified grading scale with slightly different thresholds
# to demonstrate the modified grading feature.
#
# Format: Each entry is "threshold: letter_grade"
# Thresholds should be in ascending order and represent percentages (0.0-1.0)

scale:
  0.00: F      # Below 65%
  0.65: D      # 65-72%
  0.72: C-     # 72-75%
  0.75: C      # 75-78%
  0.78: C+     # 78-82%
  0.82: B-     # 82-85%
  0.85: B      # 85-88%
  0.88: B+     # 88-91%
  0.91: A-     # 91-95%
  0.95: A      # 95-98%
  0.98: A+     # 98%+

# Notes:
# - This is a slightly more lenient scale than strict-letter-grades.yaml
# - Used for testing the modified grade feature
